# Simple React TS App

This project is a straightforward **React + Vite + TypeScript** application designed to manage employee data. It consists of two pages: 
1. **Add Employee**: A form to add new employees to the database.
2. **Retrieve Employee Info**: A page to fetch and display stored employee details.

## Frontend
- Built with **React** and **TypeScript** for a robust and type-safe user interface.
- Uses **Vite** for fast development and build processes.

## Backend
- Powered by an **Express.js API** for handling all server-side operations.
- **PostgreSQL** is used as the database to store employee information.
- The backend is fully **Dockerized**, ensuring easy deployment and scalability.

## Features
- **RESTful API**: Facilitates seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Database Integration**: Efficiently handles CRUD operations with PostgreSQL.
- **Type Safety**: Both frontend and backend are strongly typed for better reliability.
- **Containerization**: The Dockerized backend ensures a consistent development environment.

This project serves as a solid foundation for learning and implementing a full-stack application with modern technologies like React, Express, PostgreSQL, and Docker.
